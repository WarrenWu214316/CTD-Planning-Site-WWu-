{"name":"Ctd-planning-sitewwu","tagline":"","body":"For the website creation project, I would like to create a website that explains tips and tricks about the world-famous sandbox game produced by Mojang, Minecraft. I feel like this would be a good topic, since many players today cannot understand the rules of Minecraft. Minecraft was a game made to inspire people of any age to build their imaginations inside a virtual world made to be very similar to real life. The game drops the player into a computer seed generated world containing resources that the player must find in order to survive and thrive, this is rather realistic, due to the fact that no one would be there beside you to help you survive in real life. Besides the basics, I could also include tips and tricks on improving gameplay and to help advertise the game to more people, and possibly change the minds of people who dislikes the game due to not understanding it.\r\n\r\nI expect the website to have:\r\n- Pages explaining the history and giving credit to the creators and enhancers of the game, listing a link to the official forums.\r\n- Pages including showcases of certain features of the game and crafting recipes that some may be unable to memorize.\r\n- Pages that include game enhancers (texture packs, mods, shaders, etc.) Giving credit to creators and official thread to download link.\r\n-Images that go along with each page.\r\n-Description to each page.\r\n\r\nMy client would be my friend Chun-Kit Wan from the same IT CTD class, since he and I are both very interested in the game and it was I who brought back the game to him after he stopped playing for a while. I feel that if I could work with someone who I feel comfortable speaking to, I could perform much better for the outcome of the project. I would acquire help from my other peers who are also fascinated in the game and together we can add to the website with every knowledge we own about the game, hopefully learning something new during the process.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
